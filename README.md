### Snack Shack Signup Genius Banner

The Snack Shack Signup Genius Banner is a simple banner that displays the volunteer status for our snack shacks and a link to the Signup Genius registration page.

The banner is displayed on the top of the page and is a fixed position. It is updated every 15 minutes using github actions and the SignUpGenius API.

The "Sign Up" button links to the League's active SignUp Page - https://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080C44AEAB2EAAFF2-54832801-evll#/
